And I think that even beginners can read Latin without translating it into English first. To that end, I have begun to develop what, to the exten of my knowledge, I believe is a novel approach to learning and reading the language. Working through backwards design, I asked myself the following:</p></br>
		<dl id="latin-for-research">
			<dt>What should a learner be able to do when they have "learned" Latin?</dt>
			<dd class="italic">Read Latin fluently, left-to-right.</dd><br>
			<dt>What does an expert do to read fluently, left-to-right?</dt>
			<dd class="italic">They use an internal decision tree to make predictions and either affirm or reject them as they proceed through the sentence.</dd><br>
			<dt>How do we make predictions when reading?</dt>
			<dd class="italic">We encounter familiar patterns.</dd><br>
			<dt>But Latin doesn't have sentence patterns!</dt>
			<dd class="italic">Latin absolutely has sentence patterns, it just shifts syntax to emphasize or de-emphasize sentence elements.</dd>

				<dd class="wide-details">I applied for and was awarded a grant to lead a team in developing a K-12 <abbr title="Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion">DEI</abbr> curriculum. We met throughout the summer to discuss our audiences and stakeholders and to write the scope and sequence. Throughout the year we worked with the four divisions to train faculty and to advise in the implementation of the curriculum through various activities. To the best of my knowledge, this curriculum is still being implemented to this day.</dd><br>

				<dd class="wide-details">Latin programs are often in need of justification to administration, and this program was no exception. However, during my tenure at Bryn Mawr, we implemented a new strategic plan and also saw the placement of a new Head of School. This meant that in nearly each of my years, it was necessary to revamp the curriculum to account for the cost of the program, pressures from students and parents about workload and the number of academic classes required of students, and Byrn Mawr's own traditional relationship with the Classics. This frequent revisiting of the curriculum meant that I gained significant experience identifying stakeholder goals, analyzing my target audience through end of semester and end of year evaluations, clarifying the goal and purpose of the Latin program, and creating well-aligned outcomes, assessments, and learning experiences.</dd>

					<dd>As the individual responsible for putting together <abbr title="Pay Per Click">PPC</abbr> advertising for both department-specific consignment-getting campaigns and sale campaigns, I frequently meet with department specialists who have a strong knowledge of their field, buyers, and consignors.While they are familiar with their networking audiences, they are less well-versed in the nuances of online search audiences.

				<dd>As part of an initiative to improve SEO performance and meet client needs, I have initiated the creation of previously defunct Artist Biography pages, initiated a redesign of our department pages, and initiated an accessibility audit of the company website. All of these projects involve coordination with the SEO specialist, senior stakeholders, external advisors, internal creative producers, and our brand manager. It also involves personal training in JavaScript, semantic HTML markup, <abbr title="Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, <abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> AA compliance, and assistive technologies. To ensure persistence and future maintenance of these initiatives, I am also developing a manual for the production and upkeep of the pages and general site accessibility.</dd><br>

				<dd>I have taken on three web-development projects in my current position: creating an artist database, redeveloping the department landing pages, and performing an accessibility audit. The first two of these projects involve working with an out-of-the-box front-end <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> for which I am creating custom HTML and inline CSS so that the pages better adhere to brand and SEO requirements. The accessibility audit will provide both "quick win" opportunities and make recommendations for tickets to be sent to the webhost.</dd><br>
